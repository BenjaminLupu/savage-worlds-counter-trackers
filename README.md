# Savage Worlds Counter Tracker
In all tabletop roleplaying games, players must keep track of indicators (e.g. hit points, number of turns a spell lasts, etc.). Most of the time, it's done with a good old sheet of paper, a pencil and an eraser. The more adventurous use dice or small counters, which you can buy online. Legend says that some players even manage to use their memory. So what is this counter tracker? **This project aims to use our smartphones for bookkeeping during IRL Savage Worlds sessions**.
> [!NOTE]
> If you're not familiar with **Savage Worlds**, it could well be your next **roleplaying game**. Savage Worlds is a classless game focused on a **fun, fast-paced, action-packed experience**. Savage Worlds lets you play in an infinite number of worlds. Fantasy? Espionage? Space opera? Superheroes? Savage Worlds gets you covered.

## Features
During a game of Savage Worlds, players track the following indicators for their characters:
- Bennies (chips that can be used to change the course of the game)
- Wounds
- Fatigue
- Power Points _if the character has any powers (e.g. a spell-casting magician)_

Savage Worlds Counter Tracker provides a counter for each of these indicators. In addition to these counters, it also provides tracking of wounds and fatigue malus, as well as ready-to-use generic counters.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Savage Worlds Counter Tracker is based on Savage Worlds Adventure Edition.
